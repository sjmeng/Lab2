                Day 1: I got a cat
            </h2>
                <p> 
                    His name is <i>Sherbet</i>. The shelter said he's been returned a couple times. I wonder why??
                     He seems sweet. He's really reclusive, but I'm sure we'll get along with each other. 
                     My dog Drax is throwing a tantrum and has refused to be in the same room as him so far. Absolute baby. Here's a pic! <img src = "https://github.com/sjmeng/Lab2/blob/master/images/cat.jpeg?raw=true" alt = "Sherbet">

            <h2>
                Day 2: Going downhill
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sherbet has gone on a bit of a bender recently. I think he has some arsonist tendencies because every time I leave for groceries, the apartment is on fire when I get back. 
                Honestly <em>super</em> annoying because I didn't register a lot of my valuables with my homeowner's insurance yet. Also, Drax fell into one of the interdimensional portals that keep appearing 
                 on the walls and floors every time Sherbet gets frustrated that he's not allowed to chase the birds outside our window. They sound like this.<br> <audio controls= "controls" src = "images/clip.mp3">Your browser does not support this element</audio> <br>He's fine now, but I'm seriously considering a spray bottle for Sherbet
                 if this behavior continues. And it's not like I'm going to give in and let him chase the local fauna. He may be an interdimensional being, but I will not let him be an eco-terrorist.

                Day 3: Crisis averted
            </h2>
            <p>
                Everything's fine now. Turns out all I needed to calm him down was playing an ASMR video off of Youtube. 
                <br> My apartment is mostly back to normal, with the exception of a couple of stubborn burn marks on the wall. <iframe width = "420" height="345" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/guwEZLqTdGA"></iframe>
                <br><br>My calf keeps getting stuck in the portal by the door mat that won't go away, though.
